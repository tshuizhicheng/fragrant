Standalone CMake Project
When building Google Test as a standalone project, the typical workflow starts with:
mkdir mybuild       # Create a directory to hold the build output.
cd mybuild
cmake ${GTEST_DIR}  # Generate native build scripts.

If you want to build Google Test's samples, you should replace the last command with
cmake -Dgtest_build_samples=ON ${GTEST_DIR}
